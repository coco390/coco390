ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Constance!
I'm returning to the tech industry with a focused interest in front-end development, this tech major, previously a teacher, is actively upskilling through Coursera's Meta Front End Development course. 
This comprehensive program complements my previous existing skills and empowers me to tackle moderan web development with confidence. Leveraging my pedagogical background, I will intertwine instructional strategies with coding techniques, aiming to create engaging and user-centric web experiences.
This transition marks the beginning of an exciting journey blending education, technology, and innovation in front-end development.
